<h1>The Best Games According to Amogh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 games of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>GTA series</h3>
<p>One of the best games ever made.With multiple options to the player whether to free roam or to play the story line is a perfect time passer.</p><br>
<h3>Prince of Persia series</h3>
<p>Good parkour game with excellent story line. A lot of boss fights makes it even more interesting</p><br>
<h3>Cricket 007</h3>
<p>As a Cricket fan it would be impossible for me to not list this game. A great game for its time with many features and modifications given access to the player.</p>
